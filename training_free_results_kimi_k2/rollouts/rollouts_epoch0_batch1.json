Given that this is a storage tank image with multiple white tanks visible, and considering the typical image coordinate system where the y-axis increases downward (image coordinate system), the northernmost side corresponds to smaller y-coordinate values.\n\nFrom the detected 62 contours and analyzing the coordinate options:\n\nThe coordinates (570, 240) would place the tank in the upper right area (northwest if y-axis goes north-town which is typical for image coordinates)\n\nThe coordinates (240, 570) would place it lower left area\n\nThe coordinates (270, 540) would place it lower left area\n\nThe coordinates (540, 270) would place it in the upper right area\n\nBased on the image analysis and typical storage tank placement patterns in satellite imagery, the most likely location for the northernmost white storage tank would be:\n\n<Answer>About (570, 240)</Answer>"
