The GSD is 0.11 m/px, and the options are about 50, 75, 100, and 125. \n\nLooking at typical plane sizes in remote sensing imagery and considering the distance between two closest planes, a distance of about 75 meters would be reasonable for planes parked or positioned near each other in an airport setting. This would correspond to approximately 682 pixels at the given GSD (75 / 0.11 ≈ 682 pixels), which seems plausible for the scale of objects in remote sensing imagery.\n\n<Answer>B</Answer>"
